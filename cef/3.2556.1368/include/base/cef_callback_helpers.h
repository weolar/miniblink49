// This defines helpful methods for dealing with Callbacks.  Because Callbacks
// are implemented using templates, with a class per callback signature, adding
// methods to Callback<> itself is unattractive (lots of extra code gets
// generated).  Instead, consider adding methods here.
//
// ResetAndReturn(&cb) is like cb.Reset() but allows executing a callback (via a
// copy) after the original callback is Reset().  This can be handy if Run()
// reads/writes the variable holding the Callback.
