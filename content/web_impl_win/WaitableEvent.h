// A WaitableEvent can be a useful thread synchronization tool when you want to
// allow one thread to wait for another thread to finish some work. For
// non-Windows systems, this can only be used from within a single address
// space.
//
// Use a WaitableEvent when you would otherwise use a Lock+ConditionVariable to
// protect a simple boolean value.  However, if you find yourself using a
// WaitableEvent in conjunction with a Lock to wait for a more complex state
// change (e.g., for an item to be added to a queue), then you should probably
// be using a ConditionVariable instead of a WaitableEvent.
//
// NOTE: On Windows, this class provides a subset of the functionality afforded
// by a Windows event object.  This is intentional.  If you are writing Windows
// specific code and you need other features of a Windows event, then you might
// be better off just using an Windows event directly.
