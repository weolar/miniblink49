=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext() adds a custom extension for a TLS client 
with extension type B<ext_type> and callbacks B<add_cb>, B<free_cb> and
B<parse_cb>.

SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext() adds a custom extension for a TLS server 
with extension type B<ext_type> and callbacks B<add_cb>, B<free_cb> and
B<parse_cb>.

In both cases the extension type must not be handled by OpenSSL internally
or an error occurs.

SSL_extension_supported() returns 1 if the extension B<ext_type> is handled
internally by OpenSSL and 0 otherwise.

=head1 EXTENSION CALLBACKS

The callback B<add_cb> is called to send custom extension data to be 
included in ClientHello for TLS clients or ServerHello for servers. The
B<ext_type> parameter is set to the extension type which will be added and
B<add_arg> to the value set when the extension handler was added.

If the application wishes to include the extension B<ext_type> it should
set B<*out> to the extension data, set B<*outlen> to the length of the
extension data and return 1.

If the B<add_cb> does not wish to include the extension it must return 0.

If B<add_cb> returns -1 a fatal handshake error occurs using the TLS
alert value specified in B<*al>.

For clients (but not servers) if B<add_cb> is set to NULL a zero length
extension is added for B<ext_type>.

For clients every registered B<add_cb> is always called to see if the
application wishes to add an extension to ClientHello.

For servers every registered B<add_cb> is called once if and only if the
corresponding extension was received in ClientHello to see if the application
wishes to add the extension to ServerHello. That is, if no corresponding extension
was received in ClientHello then B<add_cb> will not be called.

If an extension is added (that is B<add_cb> returns 1) B<free_cb> is called
(if it is set) with the value of B<out> set by the add callback. It can be
used to free up any dynamic extension data set by B<add_cb>. Since B<out> is
constant (to permit use of constant data in B<add_cb>) applications may need to
cast away const to free the data.

The callback B<parse_cb> receives data for TLS extensions. For TLS clients
the extension data will come from ServerHello and for TLS servers it will
come from ClientHello.

The extension data consists of B<inlen> bytes in the buffer B<in> for the
extension B<extension_type>.

If the B<parse_cb> considers the extension data acceptable it must return
1. If it returns 0 or a negative value a fatal handshake error occurs
using the TLS alert value specified in B<*al>.

The buffer B<in> is a temporary internal buffer which will not be valid after
the callback returns.

=head1 NOTES

The B<add_arg> and B<parse_arg> parameters can be set to arbitrary values
which will be passed to the corresponding callbacks. They can, for example,
be used to store the extension data received in a convenient structure or
pass the extension data to be added or freed when adding extensions.

The B<ext_type> parameter corresponds to the B<extension_type> field of
RFC5246 et al. It is B<not> a NID.

If the same custom extension type is received multiple times a fatal
B<decode_error> alert is sent and the handshake aborts. If a custom extension
is received in ServerHello which was not sent in ClientHello a fatal
B<unsupported_extension> alert is sent and the handshake is aborted. The
ServerHello B<add_cb> callback is only called if the corresponding extension
was received in ClientHello. This is compliant with the TLS specifications.
This behaviour ensures that each callback is called at most once and that
an application can never send unsolicited extensions.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext() and SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext() return 1 for
success and 0 for failure. A failure can occur if an attempt is made to
add the same B<ext_type> more than once, if an attempt is made to use an
extension type handled internally by OpenSSL or if an internal error occurs
(for example a memory allocation failure).

SSL_extension_supported() returns 1 if the extension B<ext_type> is handled
internally by OpenSSL and 0 otherwise.
