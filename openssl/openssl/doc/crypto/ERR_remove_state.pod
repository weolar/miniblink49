=head1 NAME

ERR_remove_thread_state, ERR_remove_state - free a thread's error queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/err.h>

 void ERR_remove_thread_state(const CRYPTO_THREADID *tid);

Deprecated:

 void ERR_remove_state(unsigned long pid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ERR_remove_thread_state() frees the error queue associated with thread B<tid>.
If B<tid> == B<NULL>, the current thread will have its error queue removed.

Since error queue data structures are allocated automatically for new
threads, they must be freed when threads are terminated in order to
avoid memory leaks.

ERR_remove_state is deprecated and has been replaced by
ERR_remove_thread_state. Since threads in OpenSSL are no longer identified
by unsigned long values any argument to this function is ignored. Calling
ERR_remove_state is equivalent to B<ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

ERR_remove_thread_state and ERR_remove_state() return no value.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<err(3)|err(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

ERR_remove_state() is available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL. It
was deprecated in OpenSSL 1.0.0 when ERR_remove_thread_state was introduced
and thread IDs were introduced to identify threads instead of 'unsigned long'.
