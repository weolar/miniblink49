// VideoRendererAlgorithm manages a queue of VideoFrames from which it chooses
// frames with the goal of providing a smooth playback experience.  I.e., the
// selection process results in the best possible uniformity for displayed frame
// durations over time.
//
// Clients will provide frames to VRA via EnqueueFrame() and then VRA will yield
// one of those frames in response to a future Render() call.  Each Render()
// call takes a render interval which is used to compute the best frame for
// display during that interval.
//
// Render() calls are expected to happen on a regular basis.  Failure to do so
// will result in suboptimal rendering experiences.  If a client knows that
// Render() callbacks are stalled for any reason, it should tell VRA to expire
// frames which are unusable via RemoveExpiredFrames(); this prevents useless
// accumulation of stale VideoFrame objects (which are frequently quite large).
//
// The primary means of smooth frame selection is via forced integer cadence,
// see VideoCadenceEstimator for details on this process.  In cases of non-
// integer cadence, the algorithm will fall back to choosing the frame which
// covers the most of the current render interval.  If no frame covers the
// current interval, the least bad frame will be chosen based on its drift from
// the start of the interval.
//
// Combined these three approaches enforce optimal smoothness in many cases.
