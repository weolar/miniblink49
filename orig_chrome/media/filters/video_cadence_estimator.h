// Estimates whether a given frame duration and render interval length have a
// render cadence which would allow for optimal uniformity of displayed frame
// durations over time.
//
// Cadence is the ideal repeating frame pattern for a group of frames; currently
// VideoCadenceEstimator supports N-frame ([a1:a2:..:aN]) cadences where N <= 5.
// Details on what this means are below.
//
// The perfect cadence of a set of frames is the ratio of the frame duration to
// render interval length.  I.e. for 30fps in 60Hz the cadence would be (1/30) /
// (1/60) = 60 / 30 = 2.  It's common that this is not an exact integer, e.g.,
// 29.974fps in 60Hz which would have a cadence of (1/29.974) / (1/60) =
// ~2.0029.
//
// The perfect cadence is always a real number.  All N-cadences [a1:a2:..:aN]
// where aK is an integer are an approximation of the perfect cadence; i.e. the
// average of [a1:..:aN] will approximately equal the perfect cadence.  When N=1
// we have a 1-frame cadence, when N=2, we have a 2-frame cadence, etc.
//
// For single frame cadence we just round the perfect cadence (~2.0029 in the
// previous example) to the nearest integer value (2 in this case; which is
// denoted as a cadence of [2]).  If the delta between those values is small we
// can choose to render frames for the integer number of render intervals;
// shortening or lengthening the actual rendered frame duration.  Doing so
// ensures each frame gets an optimal amount of display time.
//
// For N-frame cadence, the idea is similar, we just round the perfect cadence
// to some K/N, where K is an integer, and distribute [floor(K/N), floor(K/N)+1]
// into the cadence vector as evenly as possible.  For example, 23.97fps in
// 60Hz, the perfect cadence is 2.50313, we can round it to 2.5 = 5/2, and we
// can then construct the cadence vector as [2:3].
//
// The delta between the perfect cadence and the rounded cadence leads to drift
// over time of the actual VideoFrame timestamp relative to its rendered time,
// so we perform some calculations to ensure we only use a cadence when it will
// take some time to drift an undesirable amount; see CalculateCadence() for
// details on how this calculation is made.
//
// In practice this works out to the following for common setups if we use
// cadence based selection:
//
//    29.5fps in 60Hz,    ~17ms max drift => exhausted in ~1 second.
//    29.9fps in 60Hz,    ~17ms max drift => exhausted in ~16.4 seconds.
//    24fps   in 59.9Hz,  ~21ms max drift => exhausted in ~12.6 seconds.
//    24.9fps in 60Hz,    ~20ms max drift => exhausted in ~4.0 seconds.
//    59.9fps in 60Hz,    ~8.3ms max drift => exhausted in ~8.2 seconds.
//    24.9fps in 50Hz,    ~20ms max drift => exhausted in ~20.5 seconds.
//    120fps  in 59.9Hz,  ~8.3ms max drift => exhausted in ~8.2 seconds.
