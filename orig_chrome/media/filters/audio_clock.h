// Models a queue of buffered audio in a playback pipeline for use with
// estimating the amount of delay in wall clock time. Takes changes in playback
// rate into account to handle scenarios where multiple rates may be present in
// a playback pipeline with large delay.
//
//
// USAGE
//
// Prior to starting audio playback, construct an AudioClock with an initial
// media timestamp and a sample rate matching the sample rate the audio device
// was opened at.
//
// Each time the audio rendering callback is executed, call WroteAudio() once
// (and only once!) containing information on what was written:
//   1) How many frames of audio data requested
//   2) How many frames of audio data provided
//   3) The playback rate of the audio data provided
//   4) The current amount of delay
//
// After a call to WroteAudio(), clients can inspect the resulting media
// timestamp. This can be used for UI purposes, synchronizing video, etc...
//
//
// DETAILS
//
// Silence (whether caused by the initial audio delay or failing to write the
// amount of requested frames due to underflow) is also modeled and will cause
// the media timestamp to stop increasing until all known silence has been
// played. AudioClock's model is initialized with silence during the first call
// to WroteAudio() using the delay value.
//
// Playback rates are tracked for translating frame durations into media
// durations. Since silence doesn't affect media timestamps, it also isn't
// affected by playback rates.

    // |frames_written| amount of audio data scaled to |playback_rate| written.

    // AudioClock will not properly advance time (even though all data up until
    // back_timestamp() will playout on the physical device).
    //
    // To compensate for this, when calls resume, before the next WroteAudio(),
    // callers should call CompensateForSuspendedWrites() to advance the clock for
    // audio which continued playing out while WroteAudio() calls were suspended.
