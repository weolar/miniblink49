// An audio signal power monitor.  It is periodically provided an AudioBus by
// the native audio thread, and the audio samples in each channel are analyzed
// to determine the average power of the signal over a time period.  Here
// "average power" is a running average calculated by using a first-order
// low-pass filter over the square of the samples scanned.  Whenever reporting
// the power level, this running average is converted to dBFS (decibels relative
// to full-scale) units.
//
// Note that extreme care has been taken to make the AudioPowerMonitor::Scan()
// method safe to be called on the native audio thread.  The code acquires no
// locks, nor engages in any operation that could result in an
// undetermined/unbounded amount of run-time.
