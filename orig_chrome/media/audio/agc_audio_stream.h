// The template based AgcAudioStream implements platform-independent parts
// of the AudioInterface interface. Supported interfaces to pass as
// AudioInterface are AudioIntputStream and AudioOutputStream. Each platform-
// dependent implementation should derive from this class.
//
// Usage example (on Windows):
//
//  class WASAPIAudioInputStream : public AgcAudioStream<AudioInputStream> {
//   public:
//    WASAPIAudioInputStream();
//    ...
//  };
//
// Call flow example:
//
//   1) User creates AgcAudioStream<AudioInputStream>
//   2) User calls AudioInputStream::SetAutomaticGainControl(true) =>
//      AGC usage is now initialized but not yet started.
//   3) User calls AudioInputStream::Start() => implementation calls
//      AgcAudioStream<AudioInputStream>::StartAgc() which detects that AGC
//      is enabled and then starts the periodic AGC timer.
//   4) Microphone volume samples are now taken and included in all
//      AudioInputCallback::OnData() callbacks.
//   5) User calls AudioInputStream::Stop() => implementation calls
//      AgcAudioStream<AudioInputStream>::StopAgc() which stops the timer.
//
// Note that, calling AudioInputStream::SetAutomaticGainControl(false) while
// AGC measurements are active will not have an effect until StopAgc(),
// StartAgc() are called again since SetAutomaticGainControl() only sets a
// a state.
//
// Calling SetAutomaticGainControl(true) enables the AGC and StartAgc() starts
// a periodic timer which calls QueryAndStoreNewMicrophoneVolume()
// approximately once every second. QueryAndStoreNewMicrophoneVolume() asks
// the actual microphone about its current volume level. This value is
// normalized and stored so it can be read by GetAgcVolume() when the real-time
// audio thread needs the value. The main idea behind this scheme is to avoid
// accessing the audio hardware from the real-time audio thread and to ensure
// that we don't take new microphone-level samples too often (~1 Hz is a
// suitable compromise). The timer will be active until StopAgc() is called.
//
// This class should be created and destroyed on the audio manager thread and
// a thread checker is added to ensure that this is the case (uses DCHECK).
// All methods except GetAgcVolume() should be called on the creating thread
// as well to ensure that thread safety is maintained. It will also guarantee
// that the periodic timer runs on the audio manager thread.
// |normalized_volume_|, which is updated by QueryAndStoreNewMicrophoneVolume()
// and read in GetAgcVolume(), is protected by a lock to ensure that it can
// be accessed from any real-time audio thread that needs it to update the its
// AGC volume.
