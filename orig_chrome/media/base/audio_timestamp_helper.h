// Generates timestamps for a sequence of audio sample frames. This class should
// be used any place timestamps need to be calculated for a sequence of audio
// samples. It helps avoid timestamps inaccuracies caused by rounding/truncation
// in repeated sample count to timestamp conversions.
//
// The class is constructed with samples_per_second information so that it can
// convert audio sample frame counts into timestamps. After the object is
// constructed, SetBaseTimestamp() must be called to specify the starting
// timestamp of the audio sequence. As audio samples are received, their frame
// counts are added using AddFrames(). These frame counts are accumulated by
// this class so GetTimestamp() can be used to determine the timestamp for the
// samples that have been added. GetDuration() calculates the proper duration
// values for samples added to the current timestamp. GetFramesToTarget()
// determines the number of frames that need to be added/removed from the
// accumulated frames to reach a target timestamp.
